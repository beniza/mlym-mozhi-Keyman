# Malayalam Mozhi Keyman Keybaord
## mlym-mozhi-Keyman
Mozhi is one of most popular phonetic keyboarding scheme for Malayalam script. It was originally designed by Cibu for the Varamozhi project and he still maintains the [Mozhi specification](https://sites.google.com/site/cibu/mozhi/mozhi2).

## Keyman
This project implements the Mozhi layout in [Keyman 9](https://keyman.com/), the popular keyboarding application. Starting from release Keyman 9.0.528.0, the program is again made available as a free program by [SIL International](www.sil.org) after they [acquired Tavoultesoft](https://keyman.com/sil-acquisition/), the company that owned Keyman. This keyboard will support all the Malayalam Characters available in [Unicode 10](http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0D00.pdf).
